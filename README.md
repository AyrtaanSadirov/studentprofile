My name is Ayrtaan Sadirov, I am an ethnic Uyghur and an Australian Citizen. I can speak English fluently and Uyghur semi-fluently and I enjoy playing basketball and some video games. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AyrtaanSadirov/studentprofile/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Interest in I.T
My main interests in I.T would have to do with Cyber-security and Machine-learning. I am very interested in becoming a white-hat hacker, which is a hacker that is hired by companies to test their security by attempting to breach them. I’ve always had a vague interest in I.T, but they have recently become more specific and clear. 

My interest in I.T began with videogames, I loved playing them with my friends. I originally wanted to be a video game designer but then I grew past video games and moved on to other features of I.T. Videogames will always have a special place in my heart, even though I don’t play them nearly as much as I used to. 

I chose to come to RMIT embarrassingly enough because my girlfriend wanted to come here. I honestly never really cared for which university I went to. If the destination is the same, why should I care about how I got there?

I expect to learn not only to code but also how to interact and work with others in this field. I believe that being able to work with others will truly help someone succeed in any field of work.
